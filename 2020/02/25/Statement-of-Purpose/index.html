                <p>在2020Fall留学申请季时，我申请了几个美国高校的天文学博士课程。 在申请时，我写了一些申请材料，包括目的综述。现在我想在这贴上。</p>
<p>Last month, I applied to several universities in the United States for astrophysics Ph.D. program. During this application progress, I had to write some materials, including my Statement of Purpose. Now I want post it here.</p>
<h1><span id="astronomy-amp-astrophysics-phd-applicant-for-fall2020">Astronomy &amp; Astrophysics Ph.D. applicant for Fall—2020</span></h1>
<p>My academic interests focus on the field of theoretical astrophysics, including planetary atmospheric dynamics, galactic evolution. I marvel at the fact that mathematics is the language of everything in the universe. Thus, doing such researches in these fields, I can explore the mystery of the planets and galaxies combining with theoretical mathematical knowledge. To become an excellent astronomical researcher, I must have a solid foundation in mathematics as well as astrophysics. Therefore, I chose to pursue a bachelor’s degree in mathematics without any hesitation. After graduation, I entered the National Astronomical Observatories of China (NAOC) for my master’s degree in astronomy. To continue my further understand of theoretical astrophysics and realize my dream of becoming a scientific researcher, I decide to apply for the astronomy &amp; astrophysics Ph.D. program.</p>
<p>The abundant academic experiences in my undergraduate and master studies have prepared me well for the astronomy &amp; astrophysics Ph.D. program.</p>
<p><strong>I have acquired much theoretical mathematical and astrophysics knowledge very well</strong></p>
<p>These are reflected well by my high scores in some core courses. For instance, I had received A+ scores in mathematical analysis, ordinary differential equations, numerical analysis, equations of mathematical physics, galactic dynamics, and planetary space physics. Besides, I obtained awards of Outstanding Academic Achievement and Honorary Title of Merit Students during my undergraduate and master academic semester.</p>
<p><strong>I possess a wealth of experience in scientific research</strong></p>
<p>I published an SCI paper in a famous international mathematical journal(namely Boundary Value Problems) as a first author when I was a senior student. Within this work, I studied the orbital stability of standing waves for the generalized Choquard equations through a variational method. I chose this paper for my undergraduate thesis. At last, it was selected as the provincial excellent paper when I graduated. At NAOC, under the guidance of my master advisor, I had analyzed the gravity wave propagation in Titan’s upper atmosphere through establishing an anelastic linearized wave model. This article was submitted to the Journal of Geophysical Research: Planets not long before. In this project, I had acquainted with theoretical knowledge in the field of planetary atmospheric gravity waves as well as fluid dynamics and became familiar with PYTHON.</p>
<p><strong>I have strong team leadership skills and ample conference experiences</strong></p>
<p>During my sophomore year, I attended a mathematical contest in modeling as well as market research and analysis contest. In these competitions, I act as a team leader and finally won prizes. Also, during my master’s years, I attended some international academic conferences. In these meetings, I had made a lot of posters and presentations and received praise from many experts.</p>
<p>However, these studies and experiences do not satisfy my intense curiosity about astronomy and not enough to make me become a scientific researcher. I want to learn more advanced knowledge and continue researches in the field of theoretical astrophysics.</p>
<p>The range of research areas in the Department of Astronomy &amp; Astrophysics at UC Santa Cruz is very wide. The faculty researches in the Planetary Astrophysics and Extragalactic Astrophysics group include exoplanetary atmospheres, galaxy evolution. These are close to my academic interests. Thus, the Ph.D. program will provide me with an opportunity to continue my scientific research in these areas and to satisfy my intense curiosity about the planets and galaxies. Then the following are steps of my planning process for graduate study or research.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Attending Serval Advanced Courses.<br>
In the first and second year, I will attend many astronomical core courses. The graduate courses in the program cover a wide range, including numerous theoretical knowledge of astronomy and some practical operations. Through taking these core courses, my abilities in observational techniques and instrumentation, and computational simulations will be enhanced. Besides, these courses will develop my critical thinking on astronomy, which is very important and can make me an excellent scientific researcher. Finally, these courses will help me complete a qualifying examination and start to do astronomical researches quickly.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Improving My Communication and Teaching Skills.<br>
As a graduate student of astronomy, it is important that communicating with international experts. Doing scientific research in astronomy is usually requires us to collaborate with global scientists. The department of Astronomy &amp; Astrophysics at UC Santa Cruz has many excellent experts. Graduate studying in this department will provide me a lot of chances to directly connect with them, which will enhance my communication skills. Besides, I will prepare to do a teaching assistant. It can improve my ability to teach fundamental astronomical concepts to some undergraduate students and people outside the field.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Starting the Research on the Topics in the Planetary Atmosphere or Galaxies.<br>
I have been fascinated by several questions about the planetary atmosphere and galaxies. What is the nature and composition of the exoplanetary atmosphere? How do planets maintain their atmospheres? How the formation of the complicated climate systems on planets? How do galaxies evolve? I can’t wait to explore these interesting topics. There are many faculty members at UC Santa Cruz do this scientific research. For example, prof. Fortney’s research interests include the atmospheres of solar system planets and extra-solar planets. The goal of Xi Zhang’s research group is to develop a fundamental understanding of the planetary climate system. Connie Rockosi’s research focuses on the evolution of the Milky Way galaxy. These research projects need complex theoretical and modeling calculations. Using astronomical telescopes to get images and spectrums of planets and galaxies, we can analyze the composition and structure of the planetary atmosphere and survey the evolution mechanism of the galaxies. Also, we can establish mathematical modeling to research these exciting topics. I wish I could take part in these projects. I have a solid foundation in mathematics as well as astrophysics and have abundant scientific research experiences. I believe that I will do these projects pretty well. Additionally, through training in the project, I will acquaint these advanced pieces of knowledge and improve my problem-solving skills in the field of astrophysics.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Becoming an Independent Scientific Researcher.<br>
After doing several scientific research trains, I will improve my skills in solving astronomical problems. Moreover, I can also use the proficient skill to do scientific research in other subjects and even solve the problems I would encounter in my daily life.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>In conclusion, my academic interests include planetary atmospheric dynamics and galaxies. My extensive academic experiences during my undergraduate and master’s periods have prepared well me for the graduate study in the Ph.D. program. I plan to take several advanced courses in astronomy, enhance my communication skills, and then start to do scientific researches in planets or galaxies. I believe the program will provide me an opportunity to fulfill my career goal that becoming an excellent scientific researcher.</p>
