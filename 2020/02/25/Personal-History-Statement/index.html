                <p>在2020Fall留学申请季时，我申请了几个美国高校的天文学博士课程。 在申请时，我写了一些申请材料，包括个人经历综述。现在我想在这贴上。</p>
<p>Last month, I applied to several universities in the United States for astrophysics Ph.D. program. During this application progress, I had to write some materials, including my Personal History Statement. Now I want post it here.</p>
<h1><span id="astronomy-amp-astrophysics-phd-applicant-for-fall2020">Astronomy &amp; Astrophysics Ph.D. applicant for Fall—2020</span></h1><p>Growing up in a rural village in southern China, I deeply feel the importance of education to individuals and families. When I was a child, I was fascinated by night sky and wondered what twinkling stars are, where they came from, whether there is extraterrestrial life in outer space. But no one could answer my curious questions about the night sky. As a child of an impoverished family, I fall behind my city-born peers. Occasionally, I watched a TV show, namely The Universe. This educational documentary explores many scientific questions and topics about celestial bodies and galaxies through interviews with scientists. To learn much astronomical knowledge, I borrowed a lot of popular science books and other educational videos on astronomy from my classmates. These study materials reignited my curiosity about the night sky and gave me a comprehensive understanding of astronomy. Therefore, I decided to become an astronomer. My parents supported my idea. They told me that when I was born, they looked at the sky and named me Xing Wang. Xing, the Chinese character, means star. Although my parents didn’t receive a good education, they always taught me to study hard and be an excellent scientist in the future.</p>
<p>After taking high school science courses, I learned that ancient astronomers established complex mathematical systems to research celestial bodies. For example, John Couch Adams has successfully predicted the orbit of Neptune by mathematical calculation. Issac Newton created the framework of classical mechanics according to Calculus. Albert Einstein established the general theory of relativity combing with Riemannian Geometry. Thus, I realized that to do astronomical research, I must have a solid foundation in mathematics as well as astrophysics. Fortunately, I found I have potential talents in mathematics and physics. To realize my dream of becoming an astronomer, I studied hard and finally passed China’s college entrance examination, and became the first college student in my family. To prepare well for my dream of becoming an astronomical researcher, I chose mathematics as my bachelor’s degree.</p>
<p>Before entering college, I worked as a waiter in a restaurant. To support the family, my parents have to work far away from home. But they still couldn’t pay for my high college tuition. So I had to take a part-time job to pay the tuition. Through communicating with other employees in this social experience, I found they lack general astronomical knowledge. For instance, they didn’t know there are eight planets in our solar system and the principle of the solar and lunar eclipse. After knowing this circumstance, I had a deep feeling that astronomy has not been popularized. When I told them I wanted to be an astronomical researcher, they supported me and suggested that I should contribute to the popularization of astronomy after becoming an astronomer. I accepted their advice because I should do this thing if I become an astronomer in my future.</p>
<p>When I was a freshman, I got high scores in some major mathematical courses. Before entering college, I had never learned anything about computers, so it was difficult for me to learn a C++ programming course. In the second semester, I spent a lot of time to learn computer knowledge and borrowed a laptop from my roommate to practice programming. Finally, I received a good score in the C++ programming course. To continue to pay for the college tuition, I did a part-time job in a physics laboratory twice a week. Besides, I attended several national and provincial mathematical contests for undergraduates students and awarded 2nd prizes in the sophomore and junior spring semester. I studied harder and then received the Honorary title of study activist as well as Outstanding Academic Achievement in sophomore summer and junior spring semester as the top 5 % of the students in academics. It demonstrated my academic ability to be brilliant.</p>
<p>Besides coursework, my classmates and I formed a group to participate in mathematical contests in modeling and the national undergraduate market research and analysis contest. Finally, we got 2nd prizes because we successfully researched some daily problems combing with theoretical mathematical knowledge that we acquired in classes. Because of my academic achievements, I started to do mathematical scientific research under the guidance of Xiao-mei Sun, who acted my teacher in the equations of mathematical physics course. In this project, I acquainted the knowledge of partial differential equations. At last, I published an SCI paper about this work in the journal of Boundary Value Problems as a first author. Besides, I chose this work for my undergraduate thesis. Finally, it was selected as the provincial excellent paper when I graduated.</p>
<p>Of course, I didn’t forget to study astronomy. I took part in many extracurricular activities organized by the astronomical association. Besides, I borrowed a lot of astronomy books from the library to study, such as Astronomy Today, Popular Astronomy. In the junior summer semester, I attended astronomy summer schools organized by Purple Mountain Observatory, Chinese Academy of Sciences and National Astronomical Observatories of China (NAOC). Finally, I decided to enter NAOC for my master’s degree. However, I had to take the postgraduate entrance examination in China. In this exam, I must take the subject test of electrodynamics. As a mathematical undergraduate student, I did not deeply learn the core courses of physics. At first, it was difficult for me to study the electrodynamics by myself. After learning the basic college physics knowledge and combing my solid foundation in theoretical mathematics, I found I can quickly solve the problems of the electrodynamics textbook. I spent only two months to self-study it and finally passed the subject test in the entrance exam.</p>
<p>After becoming a master’s student in astronomy, I quickly learned many basic courses of astrophysics very well due to the extensive mathematical knowledge that I have studied during my undergraduate period. In the first academic year, I received high scores in core courses of astronomy, such as radiative processes in astrophysics, galactic dynamics, gravitation and cosmology, and planetary space physics. At last, I awarded the Honorary Title of Merit Students. I entered the Key Laboratory of Lunar and Deep Space Exploration in the second academic year. Under the guidance of Prof. Jun Cui and Dr. Yuan Lian, I analyzed the gravity wave propagation in Titan’s atmosphere. At first, I lacked the basic knowledge of atmospheric dynamics. Thus, I spend much time to read several academic books, including the Introduction to Fluid Mechanics and An Introduction to Atmospheric Gravity Waves. After learning this basic knowledge, I established an anelastic linearized wave model and finally solved the problem of temperature variability in the Titan’s atmosphere. This work has submitted to the Journal of Geophysical Research: Planets not long before. Besides, Prof.Cui suggested that I should attend some academic conferences to introduce my work about the gravity wave in Titan. From 2018, I have attended several international academic conferences. In these conferences, I made a lot of posters and presentations on this work and lastly received praise from many experts.</p>
<p>Until now, I still have an intense curiosity about the sky. I wish in particular to be trained at an advanced level in the field of astrophysics. My ultimate goal is to become an astronomical researcher. I believe that advanced training in a quality graduate program will help me realize my goal. The range of research areas in the Department of Astronomy &amp; Astrophysics at the UC Santa Cruz is very wide, from Planetary Astrophysics to Extragalactic Astrophysics and Cosmology. The Ph.D. program will provide me with an opportunity to continue my scientific research in these areas and to satisfy my curiosity about the universe.</p>
<p>Doing complete mathematical research on celestial bodies, we can introduce our curiosity into the universe. At present, astronomy has not yet been popularized in the world. For instance, in China, there are only a few universities that have departments of astronomy. I hope I can contribute to the popularization of astronomy in the future. Then there have more people could answer the questions about the mysterious night sky when they fascinate with the universe.</p>
